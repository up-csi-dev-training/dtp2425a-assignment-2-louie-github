"Programmer Hell"
by Louie Torres

The question repeats inside my mind,
"Why isn't my code working this time?"
I dart my eyes left, then right, it has me stressed
I see no errors, no bugs as I test

I break my code up, piece by piece
My thorough inspection yields no leads
I put a few print statements in here and there
Yet all seems normal; I'm getting nowhere

Compiler's unhelpful, the docs are sparse
All my strings look right, my ints, and my chars
Will I lose my sanity to this darn Heisenbug?
I refuse to surrender; I refuse to give up!

But the source of the cries still elude me
All's well and good, it seems to be
My logic is sound, all edge cases checked
All errors accounted for, handled and kept

And then I spot it, the source of my pain
My eternal enemy revived once again
I concede defeat, for this round he has won
Hello, missing ";" on line 31.
